# Glossary to SKOS Conversion and Interlinking Utilities

This repository provides a set of Python scripts designed to transform a simple project glossary (in CSV format) into a formal, machine-readable SKOS vocabulary. It also includes tools to interlink this new vocabulary with established external thesauri, enhancing its utility and adherence to FAIR data principles.

To demonstrate this workflow, we use the glossary from the **Soil Health Benchmarks** project, a soil-related initiative. This serves as a practical example of how any project-specific glossary can be elevated into a more powerful, interoperable knowledge asset.

## From Glossary to FAIR Vocabulary: A Project Guideline

In any multi-partner research project, a glossary is created to establish a common understanding of key terms. However, a simple list of terms and definitions in a document is often not enough to ensure true data interoperability and long-term knowledge retention. This is why we convert our glossary into a ​**SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) vocabulary**​.

### Why Convert to SKOS?

* **Common** Understanding​**​ & Reduced Ambiguity**​: By formalizing terms, we move from a simple list to a structured system. Each concept is given a unique, persistent identifier (a URI), eliminating confusion.
* ​**Data Interoperability**​: A SKOS vocabulary is machine-readable. It allows different datasets to be integrated seamlessly because the concepts they reference are explicitly defined and linked. This is a cornerstone of the **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).
* ​**Rich Semantic Relationships**​: SKOS allows us to define relationships between concepts. Our scripts establish `skos:related` links between internal terms and, crucially, `skos:exactMatch` or `skos:closeMatch` links to major thesauri like AGROVOC and GEMET. This places our project's knowledge in the context of the wider scientific community.
* ​**Knowledge Retention and Reuse**​: A formal vocabulary is a durable asset. It can be published, cited, and reused in future projects, ensuring the knowledge generated by our project has a lasting impact.

### The Workflow

This repository automates the process of creating and enriching a SKOS vocabulary through a two-step process:

1. ​**Glossary to SKOS Conversion**​: A project-specific `.csv` glossary is converted into a foundational vocabulary using the SKOS standard, where each term becomes a unique `skos:Concept`.
2. ​**Interlinking**​: The new vocabulary is enriched by adding links (`skos:exactMatch`, `skos:closeMatch`) to concepts in established, external thesauri.

## How to Use the Scripts

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* The required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Directory Structure

For the scripts to work correctly, your repository must follow this structure. All commands should be run from within the `soil_health_benchmarks` directory.

```
soil-vocabs/
│
├── soil_health_benchmarks/
│   ├── glossary_to_skos.py
│   ├── interlink_skos.py
│   ├── uk2us.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── soil_glossary.csv      # Your input glossary
│
├── ontovocabs/
│   ├── agrovoc.csv
│   ├── gemet.csv
│   ├── iso11074.csv
│   ├── inrae.csv
│   ├── she.csv                # Concepts from soil health knowledge graph
│   └── ...                    # Other thesaurus files
│
└── README.md
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `soil_health_benchmarks` directory in your terminal.

   ```
   cd path/to/soil-vocabs/soil_health_benchmarks
   ```

3. Install the required packages.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 1: Convert Glossary CSV to SKOS TTL

This step uses `glossary_to_skos.py` to convert your `.csv` file into a `.ttl` (Turtle RDF) file.

**Usage:**

```
python glossary_to_skos.py <input_csv_file> <output_ttl_file>
```

**Example:**

```
python glossary_to_skos.py soil_glossary.csv soil_glossary.ttl
```

This will create a `soil_glossary.ttl` file in the `soil_health_benchmarks` directory.

### Step 2: Interlink the SKOS Vocabulary

This step uses `interlink_skos.py` to add links from your new vocabulary to the thesauri located in the `../ontovocabs/` directory. You only need to provide the names of the thesauri you want to link against.

**Usage:**

```
python interlink_skos.py <input_ttl_file> <output_linked_ttl_file> <thesaurus_name_1> <thesaurus_name_2> ...
```

**Example:**

```
python interlink_skos.py soil_glossary.ttl soil_health_benchmarks.ttl agrovoc gemet inrae
```

This will read `soil_glossary.ttl` and the corresponding CSV files from `../ontovocabs/`, creating a final, enriched file named `soil_health_benchmarks.ttl`.

## Example Output

After running both scripts, the final `.ttl` file will contain entries that look like this. Note the `skos:definition`, internal `skos:related` links, and the external `skos:exactMatch` and `skos:closeMatch` link to several thesauri.

## Script Descriptions

* `​glossary_to_skos.py`​: The main conversion script. Reads a CSV with `term`, `definition`, `url`, and `related` columns and generates a SKOS vocabulary in Turtle format.
* ​`interlink_skos.py`​: The linking script. Takes a Turtle file as input and adds `skos:exactMatch` and `skos:closeMatch` triples by comparing labels against one or more external thesaurus CSV files.
* ​`uk2us.py`​: A helper module that contains a mapping of UK to US English spellings, used by the interlinking script to normalize terms before matching.
* ​`requirements.txt`​: A list of the Python packages (`pandas`, `rdflib`) required to run the scripts.

## Future Work and Contributions

This toolset provides a solid foundation, but there is always room for improvement.

* ​**Term Provenance**​: Currently, the scripts do not capture the source or reference for each term and definition. Future versions could include a `dcterms:source` property by adding a 'source' column to the input CSV.
* ​**Your Ideas**​: If you have questions, find a bug, or have an idea for an improvement, please **create an issue** in this GitHub repository. We welcome all contributions!
