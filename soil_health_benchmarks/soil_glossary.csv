Sustainable soil management,"Sustainable soil management comprises practices that maintain or enhance the provisioning, regulation and maintenance as well as cultural services provided by soils without significantly impairing either the soil functions that enable those services or biodiversity.|Soil management practices that maintain or enhance the ecosystem services provided by the soil without impairing the functions enabling those services, or being detrimental to other properties of the environment.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/4068/
Technosols (including constructed Technosols),"Soils with strong human influence that either contain significant amount of artefacts or have a sealed layer.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/technosols-including-constructed-technosols/
Terrain management,"Terrain management practices are principally used to reduce the slope of agricultural land in order to create plots that can be more easily cultivated, reducing water flow over the soil surface and thereby preventing erosion and enhancing infiltration.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/terrain-management/
Threshold,"Thresholds help to benchmark the state of a given soil compared to a potential for a given land use x pedo-climatic condition to assess the performance of the system being monitored.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/threshold/
Urban agriculture,"Integration of urban agriculture and food systems within cities, including the growing/producing of food, feed or fibre in and around cities.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/urban-agriculture/
Urban forestry,"Urban forestry is an integrated concept, defined as the art, science, and technology of managing trees and forest resources in and around community ecosystems for the psychological, sociological, aesthetic economic, and environmental benefits trees provide society.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/urban-forestry/
Urban green infrastructures,"A strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features, designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services, while also enhancing biodiversity. Green infrastructures in urban areas consist of vegetated green surfaces, such as parks, trees and small forests, grasslands, but also private gardens or cemeteries.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/urban-green-infrastructures/
Urban parks,"A place with vegetation, located within the city with a recreative use.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/urban-parks/
Urban system,"Urban ecosystems are cities and the surrounding, socio-ecological systems where most people live (Maes, et. al. 2016). They are very peculiar ecosystem types: they are almost completely artificial but they include, in different proportions, all other ecosystem types (forests, lakes and rivers and agricultural areas can all be part of urban fringe) and they are strongly influenced by human activities.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/urban-system/
Urban/ urbanized areas,"Areas, including cities but also smaller urban settlements and suburban areas, developed for residential, industrial or recreational purposes.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/urban-urbanized-areas/
Vegetation cover,"The presence of, annual duration and diversity of the vegetation cover and its net primary productivity is essential for soil health, providing energy and nutrients for soil biodiversity, carbon inputs to soil organic matter, and also reducing erosion and surface runoff. A more diverse and long duration cover indicates conditions favourable to soil biodiversity and health and increasing vegetation cover is also valuable for urban settings.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/vegetation-cover/
Vegetation management,"Practices aimed at managing (growing, cultivating, removing) above-ground biomass for a specific purpose.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/vegetation-management/
Water management,"Water management in annual and perennial croplands involves the management of water inputs through irrigation and water removals through drainage.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/water-management/
Water regulation and purification,"Water regulation: The capacity of the soil to receive, store and conduct water for subsequent use and to prevent droughts, flooding and erosion. Water purification: The capacity of the soil to extract, degrade, transform or contain harmful compounds.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/water-regulation-and-purification/
Weighting factor,"Reflects the importance of the criteria to the context of a given assessment. Can be determined by the user.",https://soilhealthbenchmarks.eu/glossary/weighting-factor/
