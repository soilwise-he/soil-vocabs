she:SaltCover a skos:Concept ;
    skos:broader she:SaltProperties ;
    skos:definition "Salt cover refers to the accumulation of salts on the surface of the soil, often visible as a crystalline crust. This phenomenon occurs when capillary action causes soluble salts to move upwards through the soil, where they crystallize as water evaporates. Salt cover can interfere with seed germination, plant growth, and water infiltration, and is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions with high evaporation rates.

she:SaltPresence a skos:Concept ;
    skos:broader she:SaltProperties ;
    skos:definition "The salt presence property of soil refers to the concentration of soluble salts, such as sodium, calcium, and magnesium, within the soil profile. High salt levels can lead to soil salinity, negatively affecting plant growth by altering water availability and soil structure. The presence of salts is typically measured using electrical conductivity (EC) or specific ion concentration tests. Soils with high salt presence are often found in arid regions where evaporation exceeds precipitation, leading to salt accumulation at or near the surface. Source: Rhoades, J.D., & Kandiah, A.

she:SaltThickness a skos:Concept ;
    skos:broader she:SaltProperties ;
    skos:definition "Salt thickness refers to the depth of the soil profile at which soluble salts are present in significant concentrations. This property is particularly important in regions subject to evaporation and capillary rise, where salts accumulate near the surface or at specific depths. Salt thickness can impact soil fertility and water retention, as the concentrated salts can inhibit root growth and water uptake. This property is commonly determined through soil sampling and electrical conductivity measurements at various depths. Source: United States Salinity Laboratory Staff. (1954).

she:SealingConsistence a skos:Concept ;
    skos:broader she:SealingProperties ;
    skos:definition "The sealing consistence property of soil describes the resistance of the soil to the formation of a surface crust or compacted layer, which can impede water infiltration and root penetration. This phenomenon typically occurs in fine-textured soils, such as clays and silts, where the particles are tightly bound, leading to a hardened surface layer upon wetting and drying. Sealing consistence affects water movement and can lead to surface runoff and erosion in agricultural soils. Source: Soil Science Society of America (SSSA). (2008). Glossary of Soil Science Terms.

she:SealingThickness a skos:Concept ;
    skos:broader she:SealingProperties ;
    skos:definition "The sealing thickness property refers to the depth of the compacted or sealed layer within the soil, which is typically a result of intense rainfall, drying, or tillage practices. This layer, which forms in fine-textured soils, can significantly reduce water infiltration and root growth, leading to reduced soil aeration and potential surface runoff. The sealing thickness property is crucial for understanding soil erosion risks and water management in agricultural systems. Source: Pagliai, M., & Vignozzi, N. (2002).
