she:BleachedSand a skos:Concept ;
    skos:definition "The Bleached Sand property refers to the physical characteristic of sandy soil that has undergone a bleaching process due to leaching, where minerals such as iron and other elements have been removed by water. This process often occurs in areas with high rainfall, leading to a soil that appears lighter in color. Bleached sand typically indicates low fertility and poor nutrient-holding capacity due to the lack of iron and other nutrients that are washed away. Source: Brady, N. C., & Weil, R. R. (2008).
